# My Base Knowledge

I've been learned during the last 4 years that programming is not just knowing how to write code in some language. 
There are tons of related things inside these technologies' ecosystem that goes way beyond what I thought at first. 
One of these new things is how to take notes.
I understood, by my errors, that If you properly register your discovers you would improve your productivity.
The big question is how to take smart notes and boost your productivity. 

The [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/) method, well explained in the [How to take smart notes book](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/T382CLwAjsy3fmecf/how-to-take-smart-notes-ahrens-2017#Permanent_notes), was a great find in this regard for me.  
At first, I used the [
sublime_zk](https://github.com/renerocksai/sublime_zk) extension in one of my git repositories, and it works like a charm.
